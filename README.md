# Multilabel Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using CNN

The purpose of this project is to apply a multilabel classification task to brain MRI images of distinct individuals facing Alzheimer's disease and predict the category of their disease. To achieve this, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been utilized. The dataset used for this project can be found in the link provided below.
